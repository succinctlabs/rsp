# Using cached client input

The client input (witness) generated by executing against RPC can be cached to speed up iteration of the client program by supplying the `--cache-dir` argument:

```bash
rsp --block-number 18884864 --chain-id <chain-id> --cache-dir /path/to/cache
```

:::note

Even when utilizing a cached input, the host still needs access to the chain ID to identify the network type, either through `--rpc-url` or `--chain-id`. To run the host completely offline, use the `--chain-id` argument.
